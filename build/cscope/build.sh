SUMMARY="Cscope is a developer's tool for browsing source code"
DESC="Cscope is a developer's tool for browsing source code. It has an "
DESC+="impeccable Unix pedigree, having been originally developed at Bell "
DESC+="Labs back in the days of the PDP-11. Cscope was part of the official "
DESC+="AT&T Unix distribution for many years, and has been used to manage "
DESC+="projects involving 20 million lines of code!"
